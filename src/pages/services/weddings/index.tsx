                <p className=" text-justify ">
                  The intending couple must schedule a legal interview at the
                  Registrar&apos;s Office, attending separately with required
                  documents and paying a Â£40 fee for each certificate. After a
                  successful interview, their NOTICE OF MARRIAGE is displayed
                  for three weeks to address potential legal objections. <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  Following this period, the couple receives &apos;Blue
                  Forms&apos; (wedding authorities). It&apos;s their
                  responsibility to schedule the legal interview, and until they
                  receive the &apos;Blue Forms,&apos; their church booking is
                  provisional. <br /> <br /> Upon receipt, the couple verifies
                  certificate information and informs the Minister. The
                  certificates are securely stored in the church safe until the
                  wedding day. Loss or destruction necessitates restarting the
                  process. <br /> <br />
                  Post-wedding, certificates are returned to the General
                  Registry Office with Marriage Returns, completing the full
                  Marriage Certificate.
