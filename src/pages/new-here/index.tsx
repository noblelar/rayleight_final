In this we commune with each other and commune with God.",

            just turn up and you will be welcomed at the door. There are
            normally a good number at our morning worship. The hymns are
            displayed on a video screen at morning services, usually accompanied
            by the organ, though a piano is sometimes used. There is also a
            newly formed music group. (Please let us know if you cannot see the
            screen as we can provide printed sheets and hymn books. Large Print
            and Braille are available)
