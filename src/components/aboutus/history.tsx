          John Wesley visited the old town of Leigh several times between 1748
          and 1756 to set up a Methodist Society. On one of these occasions
          (27th November 1755) his chaise got stuck in the ruts 2 miles from
          Rayleigh and he and his companions "thought it best to walk to the
          town though the road was both wet and dirty. Leaving them at Rayleigh
          I took horse again". It was undoubtedly from this Society at Leigh
          that "apostolic fishermen robed in blue jerseys" started to hold
          meetings in a house in Eastwood Road in about 1837.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the following years, the responsibility for the Methodist cause
          in Rayleigh seems to have been in the hands of two gentlemen, both
          local preachers. Richard Frost (and his wife Sarah) came to Rayleigh
          from Bury St. Edmunds in 1842, taking over a shop in the High Street
          (where Boots now is) as straw hat and glove makers. The following year
          William Blomfield from Ipswich arrived and took over a shop (where
          Card Factory now is) as an Insurance Agent, Linen and Woollen Draper
          and Tailor. Richard Frost offered the Methodists a room over his shop
          and it is said that a local preacher from Leigh recorded how he found
          only a handful of people and on another occasion a veteran preacher
          who had intended giving a discourse to "saints and sinners alike"
          found only a select few and felt it best to devote his time to the
          saints and leave the sinners out of it. Mr. Frost insisted that the
          preacher should deliver both parts. Messrs. Frost and Blomfields'
          names are recorded as Society, Chapel and Circuit Stewards in the
          following years and their hard work and enthusiasm kept the Methodists
          going.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Methodist Society was mentioned as part of the Maldon Circuit in
          1847 in some notes found at Trinity Church at Chelmsford and according
          to Whites Directory for 1848 "Wesleyans had a small place of Worship".
          On the plan for January to April 1849, Rayleigh is included having
          three services, 2.30 and 6.30 on Sundays and 7 on Thursdays and from
          then on Rayleigh is included in plans and mentioned in Quarterly and
          Local Preachers Meeting minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The religious Census of 30th March 1851 describes the place of worship
          as "House used for religious purposes only". Numbers given are 20 in
          the afternoon and 25 in the evening. It was signed by W. Blomfield.
        </p>

        <p>
          In September 1854 the new Leigh Circuit was formed from the Maldon one
          because, I'm told, one of the young men complained that it was too far
          to walk from Maldon to Leigh. Rayleigh is mentioned regularly until
          December 1866.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Local Preachers minutes state "Rayleigh to be left off" and
          the schedule showing places of worship given up dated 29th December
          1873 states that "it was not worth continuing". The accommodation was
          described as a room lent (not rented). I believe that from then the
          Methodists attached themselves as a class to Hadleigh, in order to
          keep their membership current, under the leadership of Richard Frost
          who is listed as a class leader at the time. Where they worshipped is
          not known.
        </p>

        <p>
          Newspaper reports state that a Baptist Sunday School had started
          meeting in 1807 in the Girls School (next to the Baptist Church). This
          Sunday School was interdenominational, staffed by people from all
          churches in Rayleigh including Josiah Blomfield (son of William). He
          left in December 1884 to help start a Sunday School in the Wesleyan
          Preaching Room. In a report on Methodist Sunday Schools for the year
          ending 31st December 1884 it states that a Sunday School had been
          started.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Samuel Gilson came to Rayleigh in 1863 from Colchester where he
          and his family had been active in the Methodist Society. He took a
          grocers shop in the High Street (where Dorothy Perkins now is).
        </p>

        <p>
          At the June Quarterly Meeting of 1884 he "spoke of the desire of the
          people that a cause should be opened at once" at Rayleigh and the
          Meeting agreed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early in 1885 circulars were issued making an appeal for funds to
          erect a new Wesleyan Chapel in Rayleigh. The Southend Observer states
          that "an admirable site for the Chapel was secured in the front street
          nearly opposite the Girls School at a cost of £100. An estimate of
          £700 was submitted by Mr. J. Steward, a builder of Southend and
          accepted. On Wednesday 22nd April, the Stone laying Ceremony took
          place and a luncheon was held at the Golden Lion, then a service
          conducted by Rev. J.C. Harrup at which the stones were laid by Mrs.
          Baxter, Mrs. Braithwaite, Mrs. Ogglesby and Mr. W.L. Blomfield who was
          90 the following week. A public tea and meeting followed in the Girls
          School.
        </p>

        <p>
          The opening of the new Chapel took place on Tuesday 7th July. A tea
          was served in a marquee in Mr. Lukers meadow followed by a public
          meeting in the new Chapel. The total cost of the Chapel was just over
          £1,000 and at the opening only £175 remained to be raised. Sadly
          Richard Frost had died in October 1882 and had not therefore lived to
          see the Chapel opened. Under the stone laid by Mrs. Baxter is a cavity
          in which is deposited an account of the stone laying, a circuit plan,
          the Sussex Weekly News of April 17th, the Southend Standard of April
          17th, the Southend Observer of April 18th, the Wesleyan Methodist
          Recorder of April 17th, a list of the Trustees and Coins; a florin,
          shilling, sixpence, threepence and a farthing all of that year.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Methodist Society thrived and at the quarterly Meeting in June
          1901 a scheme was sanctioned for the erection of a Sunday School (on
          the corner of Love Lane) at an estimated cost of £500. Various fund
          raising events were held and the stone laying took place on Wednesday
          9th July 1902 and the opening was in November of that year. Mr. Smee
          of Leigh as the architect and Mr. J. Byford the builder at a cost of
          £600.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1904 Rev. Nehamiah Curnock moved to Rayleigh from Southend and
          while he was here worked on and published his translation of Wesleys
          Diaries and was active in the work of the church. His daughter, Ruth,
          was even more active in the suffragette movement and in 1911 threw a
          brick through the window of the Rayleigh Post Office I'm told.
        </p>

        <p>
          Various activities are mentioned including Wesley Guild, Boys Brigade,
          Penny Bank and Coal Club. Every year there was an Egg Service at which
          eggs were collected and taken to the East End of London presumably to
          our Mission. In December 1904 the Local Preachers minutes state "It
          was reported that one Sunday morning the GER had put on a train up to
          Wickford starting at a time enabling such to reach Rayleigh a few
          minutes after 11.00 a.m. and it being understood that the train was on
          as a trial the Secretary was instructed to write to Mr. R.P. Ellis the
          newly appointed GER Manager at Liverpool Street also a member of the
          1st London District Local Preachers Committee asking him in event of
          such being continuously run to use his influence in having such start
          a few minutes earlier thereby assisting the Brethren for Rayleigh
          appointments".
        </p>

        <p>
          The following meeting in March records "Correspondence from Mr. R.P.
          Ellis re train from GER station on Sunday mornings. Information was
          given to the effect that the train now started 5 minutes earlier".
        </p>

        <p>
          An interesting item in the Circuit Magazine in January 1911 states "In
          the midst of the intricacies and crooked ways of the General Election
          we found time by greater intricacies and crooked ways to raise a very
          creditable sum of money for umbrella stands". They had their
          priorities right in those days!
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1905 Rayleigh was granted its first active minister Rev. Henri R.
          Tourtel with responsibility for Rayleigh, Rochford and Hockley. We had
          previously had the services of supernumerary ministers, Rev. Lamb and
          Rev. John Gibson who died in April 1910 as a result of a tramcar
          accident in Southend. Mr. Tourtel was taken ill and went to South
          Africa "as the only means of saving his life". He was followed at
          Rayleigh by Rev. N.E. Dando who was training and left to go back to
          college in 1910 and from then on we had a fully qualified minister
          appointed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somewhere prior to 1916 several gentlemen began holding services at a
          barn and called the Rayleigh Mission and at the Quarterly Meeting of
          March 1917 a commission of enquiry was set up to look into the
          purchase of a site for a building to house this work. A Mr. T.T.
          Robinson was willing to give the freehold land. The work was under the
          jurisdiction of the Rayleigh Leaders Meeting. At a meeting held in
          November 1920 Mr. Robinson said that he did not propose to ask for any
          financial undertaking from either the Rayleigh Church or the Quarterly
          Meeting and was prepared to give the foundations for the Mission
          Building.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1921, a Trust was set up and the land conveyed to the Trustees. The
          contract for the new Chapel was placed with Messrs. Harrison of London
          for £445 and arrangements for Opening Services were reported in March
          1922. At the Quarterly Meeting of December 1924 it was reported that
          Mr. Robinson had died and in December the following year that the
          Mission was now free of debt.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been unable to trace any records of the activities for the
          following years but during the 1960's the work declined and the
          decision was taken to close the Mission;, the final services taking
          place in November 1964. I remember the Mission as a corrugated iron
          building which stood in Eastwood Road where the houses numbered 335
          and 335a now stand. The money from the sale of the land was divided
          between Rayleigh and Hockley Churches.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1926 the Quarterly Meeting minutes record a decision to split what
          had now become the Southend and Leigh Circuit. No specific reason was
          given but it covered a vast area (from the Crouch in the north to the
          Thames in the south and from Wickford in the west to Shoeburyness in
          the east) with numerous Chapels and proposals for many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          In November 1927, discussions began on the subject of a Manse at
          Rayleigh. From the estimates received J.T. Byford's was accepted (and
          I believe it was built in 1928) at a cost of £1,342.16.115 (cost of
          site being £265).
        </p>

        <p>
          The 1930 Conference agreed that the "Chapel in the High Street be sold
          and a new Chapel built". The reasons given by the Trustees were
          various including the fact that they considered that end of the town
          "downtown". In fact the Chapel was inadequate. In 1923 three Methodist
          gentlemen (Messrs. Bowles W.F. Gilson, son of Samuel and Crowle Smith)
          had bought a piece of land in Eastwood Road. It was decided in 1930 to
          buy this land from them to build the new Church but there was a
          restrictive covenant which meant that the land could be used only for
          residential purposes. The removal of this covenant proved complicated
          and in July 1931 the Trustees decided not to proceed.
        </p>

        <p>
          They considered a site owned by Mr. Finch but turned it down because
          of the "close proximity of the Fried Fish Shop not desirable". A site
          at the top of London Hill was considered but was not proceeded with.
          Mr. Finch offered another site next to the Peculiar Peoples Chapel
          (now Evangelical) and the Trustees started negotiations but "decided
          that the Trustees regret that owing to the grave objections that have
          come to their notice from the members of the Church, they consider it
          advisable to suspend procedure with the site". The Peculiar People
          were very noisy at worship.
        </p>

        <p>
          By July 1932, the Trustees were desperate and called the Church to
          prayer over this matter and stated that the first site considered
          "would meet with the general approval.....provided the restrictive
          covenant be satisfactorily removed". In February 1933, the Solicitors
          were still trying to remove the covenant. The minutes report an
          anonymous gift of £2,000 at this stage. On October 6th 1933, the
          Solicitors were authorised to complete the purchase. The cost of the
          new Church (including the site, heating and lighting) was £6,168. A
          tender by Mr. Green of Leigh of £4,500 was accepted at the April
          meeting. (In September it was agreed to build a house for the
          Caretaker at a cost of £450). The Stone Laying of the new Church took
          place on 20th June 1934, at which 50 stones were laid. It was preceded
          with a sale of work and followed by a tea and public meeting all held
          at the Clissold Hall opposite. On 7th November at 4.00 p.m. the new
          Church was opened.
        </p>

        <p>
          The old Chapel in the High Street was sold to the Salvation Army for
          £2,000 on condition that the Trustees did not have to pay the legal
          costs. Our Trustees charged the Salvation Army £9- interest because
          there was a delay in the conveyancing due to a problem over a right of
          way. The debt on the Church gave rise to considerable worry especially
          because of the difficulties and problems due to the Second World War
          but was finally paid off in 1941. I believe that the Church had some
          damage due to enemy action but no details are given in the minutes. In
          1953 the Trustees decided to buy the copse to prevent a builder
          putting two houses on it and the following year sold the land at the
          back of the Church where part of Nursery Close is now.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1958 a Wives Club started, Sisterhood and Wesley Guild having been
          mentioned from the time of the old Chapel. Scouts started in 1960 and
          Guides in 1961. In 1962 a 20 Plus Group was formed. In September 1964
          the Sunday School Committee agreed to change to the morning. Because
          of this change additional accommodation was required and after a lot
          of fund raising, the result of a legacy and half the proceeds from the
          sale of the Mission, two new rooms were built at the back of the
          existing halls and opened on 19th December 1971.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1977 as a result of wear and tear and dry weather the organ was
          found to be in need of repairs and modernisation and the work was
          carried out in 1980. This is the organ that was originally in the old
          Chapel and moved to the new one in 1934. It seemed to me as I listened
          to the Christmas story being read this year that Rayleigh has indeed
          benefited from "3 wise men" in two instances. Firstly, the efforts of
          Richard Frost, William Blomfield and Samuel Gilson undoubtedly kept
          the Methodist cause alive before a Chapel was built and secondly from
          the wisdom of the 3 gentlemen (Bowles, W.F. Gilson and Crowle Smith)
          who saw the need of a move from the old Chapel long before any
          decision was reached and bought the land on which our Church now
          stands. When the debt of the Church was finally paid off in 1941 the
          minutes state "The debt has been removed and we trust the Church will
          press on with the great work and become a blessing to all around".
          AMEN!
